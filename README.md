# Assignment 3 - Typescript

Welcome to Assignment 2! This is the Typescript setup repository for Assignment 2. You can find the assignment PDF on Canvas.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You hopefully have this already from A0.
If you don't have them installed, you can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, install the dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

## Assignment

Currently, this is just starter code with a basic sum function and a test case for it. 

Your task is to implement a GQL server using the Apollo Server library. You will need to implement the queries and mutations specified in the assignment PDF. You do not need to write any tests this time around, but we do need manual testing screenshots in the design document.

To fix linting issues - 
```
npm run fix
```

You can find more helpful commands in the `package.json` file.


Good luck and have fun!
